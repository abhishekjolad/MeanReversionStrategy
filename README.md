# Mean Reversion Trading Strategy

## Project Overview

This project implements a Mean Reversion trading strategy using Python. Mean Reversion is a popular quantitative trading strategy that assumes asset prices will revert to their historical mean over time. This project is designed to help beginners and enthusiasts understand and implement a basic Mean Reversion strategy in a systematic way.

## Strategy Description

### Mean Reversion Concept

The Mean Reversion strategy is based on the idea that asset prices tend to fluctuate around a historical average. When prices deviate significantly from this average, they are expected to revert back, providing trading opportunities.

### How It Works

1. **Identify Asset**: Choose an asset with a historical tendency to revert to the mean.
2. **Calculate Indicators**: Use statistical measures like moving averages to determine the historical mean and standard deviation.
3. **Generate Signals**:
   - **Buy Signal**: Triggered when the asset price falls below a certain threshold (e.g., two standard deviations below the mean).
   - **Sell Signal**: Triggered when the asset price rises above a certain threshold (e.g., two standard deviations above the mean).
4. **Execute Trades**: Enter long positions on buy signals and short positions on sell signals.
5. **Monitor and Exit**: Close positions when the price reverts to the mean or predefined exit criteria are met.
